How to delete uploaded book in Google PlayBook? 

- Google has renamed the option from "Permanently Delete" to "Hide" to better match what is actually going on.  But, the effect is the same as it was before.
 
- In the past, deleting a purchased book only removed it from your library but did NOT remove it from your purchase history.  

- Now that it is called "hide" it makes it cleared what is going on.  If you want to see the book again, you can restore it to your Library using these instructions:

- Using a browser, go to the Google Play order history ( https://play.google.com/store/account/orderhistory ) 

- Under "Order history," find the book.

- To the right of the title, click "Show or hide from my library.".

- These instructions only work on a browser (not in the Play Store app) and work best on a computer where you have a larger screen.
 
- There is no way to completely delete a purchased book and all record of that purchase from your account.
 
- Hiding an uploaded book, or using "Delete" in the past, does DELETE it from your account.  If you want to see it later, you will need to upload it again.  Make sure you have a copy of any uploaded books saved somewhere before you hide them.
