What is the difference between single and multi-threaded scans? 

Can we do anything with NMAP to make it scan faster and more accurate? 

What is the difference between NMAP, Masscan, and Zmap

Single threaded scans  process each task command at a time which will lead to slow performance comparing to multi threaded scans that ultilize multiple core CPU to run many task command at a time to improve performance and efficiency

To optimize Nmap scan performance, we need to use the parametter such as -T4 for faster scan or -T0 for stealth scan to increase the performance of the scans

- Nmap is  best tool for small network and specific target
- Massscan is designed for large network
- Zmap is optimized for fast, large scale of internet scan and data collection.
