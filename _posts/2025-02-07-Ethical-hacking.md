## Discussion

1️⃣  Scoping engagement does involve "Public Speaking". This is an unspoken part of Pentesting and ethical hacking. What can we do to assist us in preparing for the Public Speaking portion of the engagement? 

- In order to assist us in preparing for public speaking, I think we need to know and practice the following:

🌺 1) Target audience: I think we need to prepare our presentation at the level of understanding of our audience.

🌺 2) Structure of the presentation: I think we need to start our presentation with an overview, explain our findings, and conclude with recommendation.

🌺 3) Practice the presentation: I think we need to practice our presentation in front of our team and ask for their feedback in order to make our presentation better.

🌺 4) Visual aids:  I think the presentation should have pictures, diagrams, or charts to support our points because visual aids can help to make complex information more digestive.

🌺 5) Engage the audience:  I think we can ask questions to encourage participation and be open to questions during the presentation.

🌺 6) Manage Anxiety:  I think we can keep practicing deep breath technique and positive visualization. The more we practice, the more we have confidence to present in front of audiences.

2️⃣During your passive information gathering exercise, what do you see as a roadblock to a successful passive information gathering engagement?

- For the passive information gathering engagement, I think there are some roadblocks as following:

🌺 1) Limited online information: I think some targets have limited online footprint, make it challenge to gather information. So, we need to find more sources to collect information.

🌺 2) False or misleading information: I think there is a lot of wrong information online, we need to double check the information we gather from online sources.
